# OfflineAI
OfflineAI is an artificial intelligence that operates offline and uses machine learning to perform various tasks based on the code provided.


## For people without technical experience you can buy the compiled complete offline standalone application (Now with a GUI!) for windows from here:
https://www.buymeacoffee.com/CorvusCodex/e/155047?from_page=extras


## Features
- Uses advanced machine learning techniques to generate responses
- Operates offline for privacy and convenience
- Built using the powerful **Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct.Q4_0** model trained by Microsoft

## To install OfflineAI, you will need to have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:

- llama_cpp

Please note that an internet connection is required for the first-time installation to download the necessary libraries and models ( Just for console version, on windows app you can use it fullly offline).

You can install these libraries using pip by running the following command:

'''pip install llama_cpp'''


After installing the libraries, OfflineAI will automatically download the necessary models for the application to function properly. The default model used by OfflineAI is the Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct.Q4_0.gguf model, which is a fast instruction following model.

Here are some details about the default model:

- Model Size: 2.03 GB
- RAM: 4 GB
- Model: Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct.Q4_0.gguf
- Type: Very Fast Response
- Trained by Microsoft
- Chat based model
- Parameters: 4 billion
- Quant: q4_0
- Type: Phi-3
- Licence: MIT
  
Once the libraries and models are installed, you can run OfflineAI locally on your machine without an internet connection, get Windows standalone for instant program.

### Usage
To use OfflineAI, you will need to have a model file for Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct. Once you have the model files, you can run the `Offlineai.py` script to interact with the AI. The script will print the AI's responses to the console.

Please note that while OfflineAI uses advanced machine learning techniques to generate responses, there is no guarantee that its responses will be accurate or appropriate for all situations. Use OfflineAI responsibly and at your own risk.

# Support the Development of Open-Source AI Models
If you believe in the potential of open-source AI and want to support its development, consider buying me some equipment. With your help, I can build more powerful in-house AI models that can be used to improve OfflineAI and other open-source projects.

Your support will go towards purchasing high-performance hardware such as GPUs, CPUs, and other necessary components that will allow me to train and test AI models more efficiently. This will ultimately lead to better and more accurate AI models that can benefit everyone.

Here's how you can support the development of open-source AI models:

- Buy me some equipment from my wishlist
- Support my work for a month or year by becoming a member on Buy Me a Coffee
- Make a one-time donation through Buy Me a Coffee
  
Thank you for your support! Together, we can push the boundaries of what's possible with open-source AI.
