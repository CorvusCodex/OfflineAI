# OfflineAI
OfflineAI is an artificial intelligence that operates offline and uses machine learning to perform various tasks based on the code provided. It is built using two powerful AI models: Mistral AI and GPT4All.

##Features
-Uses advanced machine learning techniques to generate responses
-Operates offline for privacy and convenience
-Built using the powerful Mistral AI and GPT4All models

###Installation
To install OfflineAI, you will need to have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:
-gpt4all
-mistralai

You can install these libraries using pip by running the following command:


'''pip install gpt4all mistralai'''

###Usage
To use OfflineAI, you will need to have a model file for Mistral AI and a model file for GPT4All. Once you have the model files, you can run the `OfflineAI.py` script to interact with the AI. The script will print the AI's responses to the console.

Please note that while OfflineAI uses advanced machine learning techniques to generate responses, there is no guarantee that its responses will be accurate or appropriate for all situations. Use OfflineAI responsibly and at your own risk.

###Models Used

####Mistral AI
Mistral AI is a state-of-the-art language model developed by Hugging Face. It is trained on a massive dataset of diverse texts and can generate coherent and contextually relevant responses to a wide range of prompts. Mistral AI is used in OfflineAI to generate responses to user inputs.
